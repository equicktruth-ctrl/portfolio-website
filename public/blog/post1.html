    <h3>Step 1: Identify Goals and Scope</h3>
    <p>Before starting, I clearly defined what the portfolio needed to accomplish: showcase my operational leadership and IT skills, include certifications and experience details, and allow easy contact. Identifying this focus helped me keep the build lean and purposeful.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Selecting Tools and Hosting</h3>
    <p>I chose technology based on simplicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Visual Studio Code offered powerful editing and Git integration. GitHub managed version control. Netlify enabled simple, automated deployments from GitHub with free SSL and global CDN.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: File Organization and Naming</h3>
    <p>Creating a clean folder structure was vital. I used a <code>public/assets</code> folder for images and simple root-level HTML files for structure. This prevented path errors and reduced deployment confusion. Consistent lowercase naming with hyphens was used for all files to avoid case sensitivity problems.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Building the Homepage</h3>
    <p>The homepage contains a strong header with blurbs on my brand statement, experience, skills, and certifications. I added contact info and a downloadable resume, styled with CSS gradients and shadows for polish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Adding Interactive Features</h3>
    <p>Integrating a contact form with Netlify Forms was surprisingly easyâ€”just a HTML form with <code>data-netlify="true"</code>. No backend coding required for submission handling. This makes me reachable to recruiters directly from the site.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Managing Static Blog Posts</h3>
    <p>Blog posts are individual HTML pages placed in a <code>public/blog</code> folder. Each article has its own well-structured page linked from the homepage. This manual approach is ideal for now, giving me control and reducing complexity without a CMS.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple hard refreshes and cache clears ensured latest changes appeared.</li>
      <li>Verifying image paths fixed frequent display issues.</li>
      <li>Careful Git commits and pushes avoided deployment errors.</li>
      <li>Netlify deploy logs were reviewed for build status and errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 8: Future Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding multilingual support.</li>
      <li>Migrating to a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo for easier blogging.</li>
      <li>Integrating analytics and SEO enhancements.</li>
      <li>Expanding interactivity with JavaScript features.</li>
    </ul>
